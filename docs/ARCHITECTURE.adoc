== Application architecture

The application is divided into two main parts: link:../src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/probes/Probe.java[`Probe`] and link:../src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/scores/Scoring.java[`Scoring`].

=== What is a `Probe`?

Probes have the responsibility to fetch data for each plugins.
They reach external system, like GitHub, the Jira, etc, and register the wanted data into a link:../src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/model/ProbeResult.java[`ProbeResult`].

A probe can retrieve any kind of data.
For boolean data (example: _is dependabot configured?_), the status of the `ProbeResult` must reflect the boolean value.
For other type (example: _number of open pull request created by dependabot_), the status of the `ProbeResult` must be `SUCCESS` if we could get the data, `FAILURE` if not.

The `ERROR` status must only be used when an error in the probe execution happened.
`ProbeResult` with this status are not persisted in the database.

Probes are executed by the link:../src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/probes/ProbeEngine.java[`ProbeEngine`].
There are conditions for each probe to be executed:

- if it has never been executed on a specific plugin, it is executed
- if the last execution of the probe on a specific plugin was done before the last code change of the plugin, and the probe is based on the code of the plugin
- if the last execution of the probe on a specific plugin was done before the last release of the plugin and the probe requires a release to have its result changed

The `ProbeEngine` is scheduled by the link:../src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/schedule/ProbeEngineScheduler.java[`ProbeEngineScheduler`] class.
This is using a CRON expression for its scheduling.
The environment variable `PROBE_ENGINE_CRON` is used to configure this CRON.

=== What is a `Scoring`?

The scoring implementation are responsible to determine the health of a plugin.
Each implementation have a coefficient which dictate how important to the global health of a plugin, this scoring implementation is.

Each implementation can use one or many `ProbeResult` of a plugin, in order to determine its score.
The value the score is a `float` between 0 and 1.

The link:../src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/scores/ScoreEngine.java[`ScoreEngine`] is responsible to execute each `Scoring` implementation on every plugins.
However, if the last score of a plugin was computed more recently than the most recent `ProbeResult` for a plugin, the scoring implementation is skipped.
This because the same score would be generated.

The execution of the `ScoreEngine` is schedule by the `ProbeEngineScheduler`, just after the `ProbeEngine` is finished.
