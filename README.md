# Plugin Health Scoring system

This project aims to introduce a metric system to calculate the health score of each plugin within the Jenkins ecosystem and reflect the final scores on the Plugin Site for the plugin maintainers and users.

This project is part of the Google Summer of Code 2022 selection for the Jenkins project.

You can find out more about the project at https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2022/projects/plugin-health-scoring-system.

## Set up the project locally

This project is composed of 2 essential services:
1. Spring Boot Application
2. PostgreSQL Database

And in order to start up these services and keep them up and running, we'll use a containerized PostgrSQL DB and build an image for the Spring Boot App using a custom Dockerfile.
All of this will be done via docker-compose.yml file.

### Steps
- Clone this repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring.git
```
- Enter inside the newly cloned repo, using:
```
cd plugin-health-scoring
```
- Generate the project binary, using:
```
./mvnw package -DskipTests
```
- Run the Docker Compose to start both the services, using:
```
docker compose up
```

### NOTE
This project uses a `.env` file (at the root folder) where we store our environment variables used for connecting to the database.
For example, here's a list of the variables you'd need to override:

```
POSTGRES_USER=changeIt
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeIt
POSTGRES_DB=testdb
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
```
